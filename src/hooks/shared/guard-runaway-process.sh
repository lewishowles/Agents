# guard-runaway-process — PreToolUse:Bash hook for Claude and Codex.
#
# Blocks the one shell shape behind the "ad-hoc verification safety" rule: a
# command whose loop is an unbounded busy spin with nothing to yield the CPU or
# end the loop. A previous agent used `while :; do :; done` to fake a hung
# process, lost track of the background child, and left it running at ~100% CPU
# for eight days.
#
# Only a header that is literally `while :` / `while true` / `until false` /
# `for (( ; ; ))` counts, and only when the command carries no `sleep`,
# `timeout`, `break`, or `read -t`. A conditional loop (`while read`,
# `while [ -f lock ]`) or a poll that sleeps between iterations is left alone,
# as is `timeout … bash -c 'while :; …'`, the sanctioned bounded form.
#
# Quoted spans are stripped before the main check so a command that only mentions
# the pattern in text (a commit message, an `echo`, an `rg` search) is not
# blocked. A busy loop handed straight to `bash -c` / `sh -c` is still caught
# unless a `timeout` wraps it.
